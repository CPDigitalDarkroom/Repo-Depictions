# Repo Depictions

This is the source I put together for my repo. I'm no master HTML or CSS coder but it works well for me. You are free to do with this code as you wish. I went ahead and posted the php files to give you examples of how I am using them.

If you find any issues let me know. If you are a master ninja css or html coder and have suggestions deffinitly let me know!
